# 👋 Hi, I’m Roman Kazička

📄 Available languages: [🇸🇰 Slovensky](README.sk.md)

👀 Passionate about **System Thinking in IT** – not just as a method, but as a mindset.  
🌱 Currently redesigning my university course *“System Thinking in IT”* to grow entirely from the GitHub ecosystem – from root to branch.  
💞️ I focus on building meaningful **knowledge systems** – for individuals, for small teams, for big dreams.

💡 **My belief:**

> Without communication, there's no understanding.  
> Without understanding, no trust.  
> Without trust, no collaboration.  
> And without collaboration, no success.

⚡ **Fun fact:**  
I teach system thinking with Git. My whiteboard looks like a commit graph.  
And yes, sometimes I dream in branches. 🌿  
Still gives me goosebumps when a student says: *"Aha! Now I get it."*

😄 **Pronouns:** he/him

## 🚀 Current Projects & Ideas

- 🎓 **Git-based education** – My entire course *“System Thinking in IT”* is built through GitHub, using versioning, collaboration, and publishing as core educational tools.  
- 🧠 **Knowledge frameworks** – Designing modular knowledge systems based on KNIFE (Knowledge-IN-Flow Ecosystem) and 7Ds method.  
- 🌐 **Multilingual publishing** – Combining GitHub Pages, MkDocs, Hugo, Docusaurus, and VitePress to create clean and accessible knowledge portals.

## ✨ Vision

To **bridge structured thinking and creative learning**.  
To empower students and professionals to **own their knowledge processes**.  
To show that **versioning isn't just for code – it's for understanding.**  
> Versioning is not just about coding,  
> it's about **systematic work with dynamic knowledge**,  
> **time travel**,  
> and **protecting your work**.
