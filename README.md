# 👋 Hi, I’m Roman Kazička

📄 Available languages: [🇸🇰 Slovensky](README.sk.md)

👀 I’m fascinated by **System Thinking in IT** – not just as a method, but as a mindset.  
🌱 I’m currently redesigning my university course *"System Thinking in IT"* to grow entirely within the GitHub ecosystem – from root to branch.  
💞️ I focus on creating meaningful **knowledge systems** – for individuals, small teams, and big visions.

💡 **My belief:**

> Without communication, there's no understanding.  
> Without understanding, there's no trust.  
> Without trust, there's no collaboration.  
> And without collaboration, there's no success.

⚡ **Fun fact:**  
I teach system thinking through Git. My whiteboard looks like a commit graph.  
And yes, sometimes I dream in branches. 🌿  
I still get goosebumps when a student says: *"Aha! Now I get it."*

## 🚀 Current Projects & Ideas

- 🎓 **Git-based education** – My entire course *"System Thinking in IT"* is built on GitHub – versioning, collaboration, and publishing as core principles.  
- 🧠 **Knowledge frameworks** – Designing modular knowledge systems based on the KNIFE method and the 7Ds model.  
- 🌐 **Multilingual publishing** – Combining GitHub Pages, MkDocs, Hugo, Docusaurus, and VitePress to deliver clean and accessible output.

## ✨ Vision

To connect **structured thinking and creative learning**.  
To help students and professionals **own their knowledge processes**.  
To show that **versioning isn’t just for code – it’s for understanding.**  
> Versioning is not just about code,  
> it’s about **systematic work with dynamic knowledge**,  
> **traveling through time**,  
> and **protecting your work**.
